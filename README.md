# SUBLIME SNIPPETS
 MY  C++ SUBLIME CP SNIPPET
 FOR THOSE WHO DONT KNOW SNIPPET FEATURE:
 It is a helpful feature offered by sublime text, just type keyword set by you and the section it trigger will appear, just go to TOOLS -> DEVELOPER -> new snippet
 and edit ur snippet and save it as "sublime-snippet" extension without quote, take the help by looking at some of my snippets.i am sure it would save you lots of time especially while doing competitive programming.
